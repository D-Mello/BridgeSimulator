#Bridge Simulator
This bridge simulator can calculate compression and tension forces on truss members.<br>
Three test bridges are provided that are ready to simulate. Simply change the file the BridgeSim.py will open and run it.<br>
I am very new to Github and am learning the ropes. <br>
If you have any questions about the project or wish to contact me, I will not know where to find you. Hopefully anyone who stumbles across this will find it useful.
